## Style Guide

### Sections

e.g. "Execute Idempotently"

* Each section should have an introduction on the index
  page which summarizes its content.

* Section introductions should be a maximum of two or three
  sentences.

* Each section should have its own landing page that
  includes expanded content and which may be broken down
  with a number of subheaders.

* Section landing pages should contain at most three or
  four subheaders. More desired subheadings may be an
  indication that the section should be broken up.

* Section landing pages should have a paragraph or two of
  general content before starting into a subheading.

### Categories

e.g. "Introduction", "Isolation"

* Each category should contain two to five sections. More
  desired sections may be an indication that the category
  should be broken up.

* Categories should include sections that have a common
  theme. This can be very high level and a little vague in
  some cases, but a section's inclusion should be easily
  justifiable.
