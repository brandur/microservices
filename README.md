# Microservices

## Introduction

### Terminology

This guide defines the following terminology for service-oriented systems:

* A **service** is a software installation that runs and is deployed independently of other parts of the larger system. It is largely interchangeable with "microservice".
* A **component** is a software module with well-defined interface boundaries that could operate as a part of service or be broken out into its own service if it's deemed to be beneficial.
* A **platform** is a greater software system that makes up all of an organization's services and components.

### Practice Moderation

Service-oriented systems can result in large organizational, logistical, and operational benefits, but have very real drawbacks. Wide reaching changes that touch many services gain significant overhead in orchestration and the system gets harder to reason about as its complexity is fundamentally increased. In many situations, monolithic architectures are more appropriate.

Practice moderation and objective thought when deciding whether to break out a service. Sketch out the API contract between itself and other components in the system. Thoroughly consider how likely those contracts are to stay roughly in the same shape over the long term. If major changes are likely, keep the monolith.

## Share Data, Not A Database

Never share an internal data schema between services because it makes changes to that schema slow, difficult, and dangerous.

Instead, have services communicate with one another over well-defined public interfaces.

## Idempotency Is the Key

Messages between systems can fail at any time, leaving one system unsure of the state of the other.

Prefer idempotent API calls so that in the event of a failure, systems can safely retry operations.

Where idempotency is not possible, use a construct like idempotency keys to ensure exactly one delivery.

## Enforce Strong Contracts

Regardless of the technology in use to communicate between services, make sure that interfaces are strongly defined and protected against accidental changes. Regressions in an API can easily break the integration between two components.

Communication via constructs like event streams and other real time APIs counts! Messages that are published into a stream should be as concretely defined as any API.

## Consider The Log

Every request between two services is a potential failure.

Where a non-interactive interface is possible, batch up communication by having services stream their state to each over a construct like a Kafka topic. This method is more robust because fewer messages need to be passed, and allows consumers to ingest changes more economically because changes are grouped.

## Ensure Correctness With Atomicity

ACID transactions are the most powerful tool in existence for guaranteeing data integrity.

Use them within the bounds of any particular service. Calls to external services can result in inconsistent distributed state, so wherever possible converge state between services asynchronously.

## Defend In Depth

Security should be layered. Services should use a secure protocol like TLS to talk to each other, even if they're known to be isolated in something like a VPC.

## Pool Connections

Speed is important and microservice architectures can introduce latency as more information is passed across networks. Use connection pools when communicating between services so that connections that were opened previously can be re-used.

This is especially crucial for secure connections which have traditionally required three round trips to construct, adding a lot of additional latency (although TLS 1.3 is likely to bring this down to one round trip).

## Normalize Practices

Services being deployed separately shouldn't mean that each one should be its own special snowflake.

The more consistent the technology stack and practices between all shared services, the lower the overhead to development and operations will be, and the easier it'll be for engineers to move between services and continue to maintain high levels of productivity. For example:

* A single protocol should be shared for all communication between services (e.g. HTTP, GRPC, ...).
* It takes a lot of experience to learn how to operate a database well, so it's best to use a single one everywhere.
* Standards around services for deployment, logging, reporting, metrics, and CI will significanly ease integration over the long run.
* Standards on languages, frameworks, and even individual libraries are a good idea to reduce cognitive overhead for engineers.
* Universal coding conventions. Use linters in CI for enforcement.

## Deploy Discretely

Like the deployment of a single component should maintain compatibility with the code that is already running, the deployment of any component should be compatible with the overall service and not rely on lockstep deployments.

## Instrument, Observe, and Correlate

Make services and the greater system observable through instrumentation and by using tracing techniques.

When a service calls into another service it should offer a `Request-Id` and identify itself with a `User-Agent` where possible. An identifier should be available to trace a request's path through the entire platform and separate identifiers should be able to isolate activity within any given service.

Services should instrument the time that it takes them to run and the time they spend calling into other services. If service time for the platform is degraded, it should be possible to tell whether time is being lost to a particular service or to degenerate network conditions.

If an integration test is running against the platform and fails, it's not enough to know just that result; the test should be able to identify exactly which service caused its failure so that fixing it is immediately actionable.
