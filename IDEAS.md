# IDEAS

Use the zen circle for page design.

Use black for text but watercolor-like backgrounds that are
soft and somewhat indistinct.

Use narrow textwidth -- LaTeX-like in that there are few
words per line. Don't go crazy on whitespace and use a
relatively conservative line height.

Include a top-level TOC that scrolls down the page with you
(unless you're on mobile, if so, it just appears at the
bottom).

## Working Titles
